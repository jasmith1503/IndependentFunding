# IndependentFunding

This repo is a collection of files used to sift through information provided from Crowd funding websites used in previous projects. Some data from a .csv file is read into a Pandas DataFrame and then manipulated using a few different techniques. Finally, the information is exported and then imported into a Postgres database. The bonus was completed which contains some extra SQL queries to analyze the data into a few different tables.
